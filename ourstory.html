        <a href="#"> On Day 2, we learnt more about CSS and UX and UI. From the innovation center a woman named Marta came and informed us about her job on the innovation team and what she gets up to day by day . This motivated and inspired a lot of us to pursue a job like Marta’s as it seemed very rewarding and there proved to be a new challenge everyday for her;which is necessary as the human mind needs to be constantly stimulated and that’s exactly what jobs like Marta’s provide. We have met the robot Pepper . Pepper is a product of artificial intelligence who was created in order to support vodaphone . We interacted with Pepper for quite a while and watched her dance laugh and pose for various pictures for us all.

We have learned quite a bit of CSS by now and it all seems fairly straightforward. You
write some CSS, tweak it here and there until it looks the way you want, and you’re
done! In theory that is exactly how CSS is meant to work and why it is brilliant.
As designs get more and more complex, for larger and larger sites - you will need to
write more and more CSS code. For simple designs like navbar, tables and modals, lots
of other people will have written css to create them on their website, so it is counter-
productive for everyone to write their own version.
About 5 years ago, ‘all’ you would have had to worry about is the cross-browser
display issues. Since then, the mobile web has exploded and you have another .</a>
