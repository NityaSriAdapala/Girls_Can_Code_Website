# Project: Girls Can Code

During the 2019 Vodafone Code Like A Girl Workshop, my team and I designed this website as part of the Course Competition, which we won. 
Highlighting our experiences throughout the 4-day workshop, this website holds many memories for us and we hope that future students can explore our website and truly get a feel for how amazing this workshop really is.
